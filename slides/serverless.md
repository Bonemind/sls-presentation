 - On demand scaling
 - Scale to 0
 - No patching and management
 - Needs an ecosystem to work

Note:
Irregular usage patterns and peaks are easily handled
E.g. A bank that experiences peaks on payday, steam during steam sales

 - More infrastructure to manage
 - Vendor lock-in
 - Everything needs to be serverless/scaleable
 - Distributed systems are hard
 - Harder debugging
